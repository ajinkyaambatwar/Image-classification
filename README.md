# Image-classification
The following repository contains work regarding image classification usinf cifar-10 dataset.
The Repository consists of modelling Of CNN architecture 
using keras with tensorflow background.
We are dealing with classification of the image into 10 different classes.

## About Dataset
The dataset is of 50000 images in total. It is taken from http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.
